(it gets better) so, the server was new. i don't think he had ever touched a bottle of wine before in his life. i asked him what is new and great on the bottle menu, he responds... \"um, i'm not for sure.\" i proceeded to order a bottle of rose, because it was nice and warm out and i was craving a nice semi-dry wine. nothing like a porch pounder! they either had godello or vermintino on the menu, but an outrageous (like most of pittsburgh) price for the bottle. ** i'm a som, but that's not for here** anyway, after bringing out a pinot noir, i sent back the bottle because that is not what i pointed at or ordered verbally. a new server came back with the other server and gave lessons on how to open the bottle of wine. i was fine with that... the more knowledge the more money. i get it. so server tells server step by step what to do...... now on to food. i ask what is on the cheese plate for the day, \"ill be back with that answer\", ten minutes later.. i get the host telling me what is on the plate. while he was trying to explain the menu, all four (water and wine) of our glasses were empty. we said we were not going to order food, so he looked at the table, said \"okay\", then vanished. note to reader... only 12 people in the entire place and we were the only people in his section until ********* his friends showed up!!!!!!!! i really wished i knew his friends because they got the smiles, the charm, a handshake, and the dl on everything from the menu. ... lucky, friends. after finishing our half ass snack that i could have made at home because my cheese drawer is more interesting then theirs, we searched and searched for our server. we eventually flagged down another server that was on the floor because our server ignored us. we asked for water and our check. we paid.. never saw the server again. we walked out. ... no one said \"thank you for spending your money here\" , \"please come back\", or even \"please sit in the middle of traffic\". what a shame.", "business_id": "CqU7SXYRo9EbMwlxrSvErA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-18", "type": "review"}
