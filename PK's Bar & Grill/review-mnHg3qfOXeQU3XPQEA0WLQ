(we had to get to another event by 8). so we ordered a 16\" pizza plain cheese. those in our group who ordered more \"elaborate\" items like sandwiches or chicken had a long wait for their order. the za tasted like it had \"been microwaved to thaw out. i've had decent fare here before. something has changed\" in fact a $4 frozen pizza from the supermarket would have tasted better and fresher. this cost over $20 for 3 w/ only soft drinks, so after a nice tip for service and tax we left. side note only street parking which is a real bear in b'burg on a sat! * 1/2 stars. i suggest we'll try sal's for real food!", "business_id": "zkmYfnGF3WilPsGiIkxYYw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}
